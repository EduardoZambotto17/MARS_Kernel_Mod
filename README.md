# Modified MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)

## Overview
This repository contains a modified version of **MARS**, the MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator. This modification was developed solely for **educational purposes** to support operating systems courses and low-level debugging activities.

## Key Modification: Kernel Memory Dump
The primary enhancement in this version is the ability to **dump the kernel memory state**. This feature allows students and instructors to inspect the kernel's memory content during execution, facilitating a deeper understanding of OS memory management and exception handling on the MIPS architecture.

## Original Credits & Attribution
